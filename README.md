# 🎮 10 Seconds Ago

> A time-loop puzzle game where your past actions become your greatest ally... or your worst obstacle.

## 🌀 About the Game

**10 Seconds Ago** is a 3D puzzle-platformer built in Unity.  
You're trapped in a room that resets every 10 seconds. After each reset, a "clone" of your past self replays exactly what you did before. Use these time-looped clones to solve complex puzzles, press pressure plates, open doors, and ultimately escape the loop.

This game was designed for portfolio purposes with a short development timeline (7 days).
